              I am a die hard tech enthusiast with a passion for learning. I have worked in the tech industry for over 5
              years and have a solid background in software development. Although I have experience in both front and
              back end development, I am currently specialized in back end development. My goal is to build top quality
              software that is easy to use and easy to maintain. I hope to accomplish this by keeping up with tested
              architecture/development practices and the latest technologies. Please visit my links below to see my work
              and social profiles. I would love to connect with you!
